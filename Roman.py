# In order to calculate the value of the sum of the list (which is equal to the value of the roman number), the program compares the value of
# one roman number to the adyacent roman number (to the left) this is expressed by: (num >= prev). In  case that comparisson results in the number
# on the left being greater than the one on the right, the number on the left is added. If the number on the left is less than the number on the right,
# then this number will be substracted to the total. The total that results from doing this operations is equal to the roman number.
